The LINCS Consortium
By generating and making public data that indicates how cells respond to various genetic and environmental stressors, the LINCS project will help us gain a more detailed understanding of cell pathways and aid efforts to develop therapies that might restore perturbed pathways and networks to their normal states. The LINCS website is a source of information for the research community and general public about the LINCS project. This website along with the LINCS Data Portal contains details about the assays, cell types, and perturbagens that are currently part of the library, as well as links to participating sites, data releases from the sites, and software that can be used for analyzing the data.
